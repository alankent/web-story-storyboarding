# Web Story Storyboarding

These files support the blog post https://alankent.me/2021/05/22/storyboarding-web-stories-with-adobe-illustrator/.

The idea is to use Adobe Illustrator to create a storyboard of a web story, iterate on it quickly, and try the rough sketches as a web story. Once the flow is worked out, then hand it over to the expert graphics designers to flesh out the quality story with separate text layers, animation, music, etc.

In a nutshell, copy the 760x1280 subdirectory files to your own directory, edit the Illustrator file putting artwork for each page on the corresponding artboard (I use an Adobe Cloud document so I can use Illustrator on the iPad with an Apple pencil), then "Export as Screens" to create a PNG file per artboard to be referenced by the provided web story HTML file (index.html).
